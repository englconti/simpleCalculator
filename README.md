# simpleCalculator

This is a simple calculator project automated with JavaScript.

The interface and style from HTML and CSS was done by a member from Discord channel "União Devs" @darthbane.

I took the files out to automate it using JavaScript making the calculator functional.

April 3rd 2022:
There are still many things to be done, such as:

1. Function to validate length of final number (avoid something like 5864.21870317684716);

2. Possibility to add negative numbers at the beginning;

3. Separate script.js in different files using modulation (try something like Model-View-Controller architecture);

4. Refactor some code into specific functions;

5. Make code more clear;
