# simpleCalculator

This is a simple calculator project automated with JavaScript.

The interface and style from HTML and CSS was done by a member from Discord channel "Uni√£o Devs" @darthbane.

I took the files out to automate it using JavaScript making the calculator functional.

Updates:

April 8th 2022:

1. script.js separated into controller.js, View.js and config.js;

2. It is now possible to put negative numbers at the beginning;

3. added config.js for configuration inputs such as max number of digits and initial screen message;

4. Some code was refactored;

April 3rd 2022:
There are still many things to be done, such as:

1. Function to validate length of final number (avoid something like 5864.21870317684716);

2. Possibility to add negative numbers at the beginning;

3. Separate script.js in different files using modulation (try something like Model-View-Controller architecture);

4. Refactor some code into specific functions;

5. Make code more clear;
